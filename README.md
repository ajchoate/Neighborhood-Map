# Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Neighborhood Map project

### How To Use
The index.html file contained in this repository initializes the Neighborhood Map, where you can find several local libraries and restaurants.

There is a filterable list containing all marked locations, and each location, when clicked, will display an Info Window containing data on the location pulled from Foursquare's Venues API.

Viewed on devices with screen width less than 450 pixels, a hamburger icon is implemented to open and close the filterable list as a sidebar.

On devices with screen width less than 850 pixels, the layout is largely the same as the desktop version, however with a larger font.
